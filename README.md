# Text Preprocessing with CBOW (Continuous Bag-of-Words)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing text preprocessing and a Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW) model using the Gensim `text8` dataset. The CBOW model is a neural network that learns word embeddings by predicting a target word based on its context, making it a foundational approach in natural language processing (NLP).

## Project Overview

In this notebook, we preprocess text data and implement a CBOW model using Keras. CBOW models are a form of word embedding model that predicts a word based on its surrounding context, which enables the generation of dense vector representations of words based on context.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Loads and previews the Gensim `text8` dataset for word embedding training.
- **Tokenization and Vocabulary Creation**: Tokenizes the dataset and builds a vocabulary with a limited size.
- **CBOW Model Implementation**: Constructs a CBOW model using Keras, with an embedding layer and mean-pooling for context.
- **Custom Data Generator**: Defines a generator to produce input-output pairs for model training.
- **Model Training**: Compiles and trains the CBOW model with a sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```

2. **Install required packages**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install gensim tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CBOW.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

To train and test the CBOW model, follow these steps:

1. **Load the Data**: Run the first cells to load the `text8` dataset using Gensim's API.
2. **Tokenize the Text**: Tokenize the dataset, define vocabulary size, and convert text data into sequences.
3. **Build and Train the CBOW Model**: Execute cells to create, compile, and train the model using the custom data generator.

## File Overview

- `CBOW.ipynb`: The main notebook file implementing text preprocessing and the CBOW model.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Loading and Exploration
The Gensim `text8` dataset is loaded, which is a large text dataset often used for word embedding models. Initial cells preview the data and analyze document lengths, preparing it for tokenization.

### 2. Tokenization and Vocabulary Building
Using Keras's `Tokenizer`, the notebook tokenizes the text data, converts it to integer sequences, and constructs a vocabulary capped at 20,000 words.

### 3. CBOW Model Architecture
The CBOW model is implemented with Keras as follows:
   - **Input Layer**: Receives a sequence of context words.
   - **Embedding Layer**: Transforms each word into a dense vector.
   - **Mean Pooling**: Averages embeddings of context words.
   - **Dense Layer**: Produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary for the target word.

### 4. Data Generator
The `data_generator` function generates batches of data for training, taking a sequence of words, extracting context words, and selecting a target word to predict.

### 5. Training the Model
The model is compiled using sparse categorical cross-entropy loss, which is ideal for multi-class classification, and trained on batches from the generator.

## Results

After training, the CBOW model learns to represent words based on context. This notebook could be extended with further evaluation or visualization of embeddings, such as plotting embeddings of common words.
